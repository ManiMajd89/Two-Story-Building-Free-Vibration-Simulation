# Two-Story-Building-Free-Vibration-Simulation
This MATLAB code simulates the free vibration of a two-story building modeled with coupled second-order differential equations. It uses Euler’s Method (EM), Improved Euler’s Method (IEM), and an analytical solution to compute and compare the displacements of the building’s floors over time.
